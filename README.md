This repository serves as a project-based learning resource for creating a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) chatbot in Python. The chatbot aims to provide personalized behavioural activation and remote health monitoring, inspired by research papers and datasets related to mental health and CBT.

## Introduction

Project-based learning (PBL) is an educational approach that encourages students to learn by actively engaging in real-world projects. In this project, we'll delve into the development of a CBT chatbot using Python, drawing insights from research papers, available datasets, and challenges associated with mental health bots.

### Datasets for CBT

Due to privacy concerns, datasets for CBT chatbots are not publicly available. However, various sources can provide valuable insights and data for adapting the chatbot:

- **Publicly Available Therapy Chat Logs**: Anonymized conversations between therapists and patients.
- **Self-Help and CBT Exercise Texts**: Texts from CBT workbooks, self-help books, or online resources.
- **FAQs and Therapy Session Transcripts**: Frequently Asked Questions or anonymized therapy session transcripts.
 **[Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Amod/mental_health_counseling_conversations)**
### Research Papers

We draw inspiration from research papers exploring the efficacy and design of CBT-based chatbots:

- **[Paper 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9586257/)**: Discusses the development of a CBT chatbot for health anxiety management.
- **[Paper 2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32446158/)**: Explores the efficacy of mobile app-based interactive CBT using a chatbot for panic disorder.
- **[Paper 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9586257/)**: Presents a pilot study on a CBT chatbot for health anxiety management.

### Challenges of Mental Health Bots

We acknowledge the challenges associated with developing mental health chatbots, such as maintaining user privacy, ensuring effective therapy delivery, and fostering a therapeutic relationship between users and technology.

## Highlights

- **Paper 1**: Introduces the concept of a CBT chatbot for health anxiety management, highlighting its potential benefits and challenges.
- **Paper 2**: Investigates the effectiveness of mobile app-based interactive CBT using a chatbot for panic disorder.
- **Paper 3**: Presents a mixed-methods pilot study on a CBT chatbot for health anxiety management, emphasizing the importance of user interaction and technology-mediated therapy.
