## Datasets for CBT:
Major concerns are getting these dataset may lead to privacy breach of individuals ,so these are not publically available
However, there are several types of datasets that could be adapted :
1. Publicly Available Therapy Chat Logs :onversations between therapists and patients, anonymized to protect privacy. However, these are rare and heavily regulated due to confidentiality.
2. Self-Help and CBT Exercise Texts: Texts from CBT workbooks, self-help books, or online resources that explain CBT concepts, exercises, and example dialogues.
3. FAQs and Therapy Session Transcripts: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) or anonymized transcripts from therapy sessions (with consent) can provide insights into common concerns and therapeutic responses.

Highlights ~ Paper 1:
Although iCBT has been adapted to suit several digital modes of delivery to treat health anxiety, to the best of our knowledge, there has not yet been a chatbot designed to help people manage health anxiety using CBT.
.A chatbot may provide an initial management intervention that reduces the burden of help-seeking individuals who may otherwise overutilize health services. Moreover, it may encourage interaction for avoidant individuals who would otherwise be reluctant to seek care, due to the presence of clinicians and anxiety-provoking settings (eg, hospitals and clinics)
To the best of our knowledge, no study has shown significantly improved anxiety compared with a control group using a CBT-based chatbot
he study found that, although there was no significant improvement in health anxiety, participants reported benefiting from the intervention, which is further evidenced by improvements in general anxiety, personal well-being, and quality of life. 
Future studies in the area should continue to investigate the “therapeutic relationship” between people and technology to aid the development of mHealth, thereby facilitating the democratization of mental health services.
