## Datasets for CBT:
Major concerns are getting these dataset may lead to privacy breach of individuals ,so these are not publically available
However, there are several types of datasets that could be adapted :
1. Publicly Available Therapy Chat Logs :onversations between therapists and patients, anonymized to protect privacy. However, these are rare and heavily regulated due to confidentiality.
2. Self-Help and CBT Exercise Texts: Texts from CBT workbooks, self-help books, or online resources that explain CBT concepts, exercises, and example dialogues.
3. FAQs and Therapy Session Transcripts: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) or anonymized transcripts from therapy sessions (with consent) can provide insights into common concerns and therapeutic responses.
